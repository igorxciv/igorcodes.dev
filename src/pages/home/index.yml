      Over the years, I've transitioned into a <b>full-stack engineer</b>, crafting projects for <b>Fortune 500 companies</b>, contributing to the success stories of large product companies, and nurturing the growth of startups. My professional voyage has taken me through diverse business domains and a myriad of technologies, allowing me to lead distributed teams with a passion for innovation.

    - Beyond the realm of coding and development, I find solace and inspiration in various pursuits. Whether it's the harmonious strumming of a guitar, <i>conquering the trails</i> during a hike, <i>capturing moments</i> through the lens of my camera, or <i>experimenting with flavors</i> in the kitchen â€“ each hobby adds its unique rhythm to the symphony of my life.
